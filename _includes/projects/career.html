            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                To find a new home where he can flourish and new challenges to take on.
            </p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <h4>User Research</h4>
            <p>
                Patrick has talked with developers, designers, recruiters, consultants, business leaders, and anyone else he could get his hands on. He’s asked them many questions and tried to understand their goals and frustrations. What drives them to do what they do, and is that drive something they share?
            </p>
            <h4>Journey Mapping</h4>
            <p>
                Patrick has begun to map out his options and the different journeys that would take him there. He has never been a “five-year plan” sort of person. Instead he has chased opportunities and challenges as they present themselves. What guides these decisions is a general direction that he wants to be moving in.
            </p>
            <h4>Prioritisation</h4>
            <p>
                Comparing places that he’d like to work is not the easiest of tasks. Short of actually getting in there and testing it out, it’s hard to tell if it is going to be a good fit. So, Patrick came up with some simple heuristics to give himself a better chance of finding a job that he will love. These are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Great people to surround himself with and learn from</li>
                    <li>A company or team mission that he can believe and invest in</li>
                    <li>A fun and diverse environment that encourages innovation and creativity</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h4>Wireframing</h4>
            <p>
                And so, Patrick has begun to sketch out his next challenge. Where he ultimately ends up is a mystery, but that’s all part of the fun.
